      <p class="The-International-Co">The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world’s universities. Established in 1970 by pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society, the contest has grown to become the most prestigious programming competition in the world. It challengesTeams of three students work together to solve a set of problems using programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, C++, and Python, with speed, creativity, and innovation being key criteria. The contest has expanded over time into a worldwide collaborative of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship round, the ICPC World Finals. The competition aims to promote ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities for the strongest students in the field of computing. It is affiliated with the ICPC Foundation and attracts the best and brightest computer science students from around the world.

      <p class="The-International-Co">
        The contest traces its roots back to a student competition held at Texas A&M University in 1970. The idea quickly gained popularity within the United States and Canada, and since 1977, the contest has been held annually. In 1989, it expanded into a global network of universities. Nowadays, the ICPC championship attracts students from more than a hundred countries.
        
        Every year the competition attracts more participants than the Olympic Games – in 2017 it was attended by 46,381 people from 103 countries, while only 11,544 athletes participated in all stages of the summer Olympics in Rio.
        
        Russia has been participating in the championship since 1995. Over the last 20 years, Russian students have won 33 gold medals and have maintained a winning streak since 2012. Last year, students from Lomonosov Moscow State University became world champions in programming. Their team took first place in the ICPC World Finals in Porto, winning the final twice in a row with the same line-up of participants for the first time. Teams from MIPT and HSE took home bronze medals.

      <p class="The-International-Co">The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software
        programs, and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. The contest has raised
        aspirations and performance of generations of the world’s problem solvers in the computing sciences and
        engineering.</p>
      <p class="The-International-Co">The ICPC features several levels of competition:</p>
      <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 700;">
        <li>Local Contests</li>

        <li>The World Finals</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="The-International-Co">
        The mission of the contest is to provide students from different universities with opportunities to interact
        with each other and to create a platform for industry, and academia to encourage and focus public attention on
        the next generation of computing professionals.

        More than 60,000 student programmers from more than 3,000 universities from up to 115 countries participate in
        qualifying rounds each year, and only the best of them reach the finals. Participants go on to receive job
        offers from technology leaders or launch their own startups.

    The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic programming contest, where the best brains compete annually. It’s a real Olympic Games for students and postgraduates, whose teams compete in terms of speed, creativity and innovation in solving problems.
The ICPC traces its roots to 1970 when the first competition was hosted by pioneers of the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society. The initiative spread quickly within the United States and Canada as an innovative program to increase ambition, problem-solving aptitude, and opportunities for the strongest students in the field of computing.

Over time, the contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first championship round conducted in 1977. Since then, the contest has expanded into a worldwide collaborative of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the annual global championship round, the ICPC World Finals.

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the world’s universities. The ICPC is affiliated with the ICPC Foundation.
