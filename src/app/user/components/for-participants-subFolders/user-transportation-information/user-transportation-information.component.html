    <h5 class="About-International">Explore Sharm El Sheikh with inDrive:</h5>

    <p class="The-International-Co">
      If you're interested in exploring the sights and sounds of Sharm El Sheikh while you're in the area for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), the inDrive application is a great option to consider. With this convenient app, you can easily book a private driver to take you wherever you want to go, whether you're looking to soak up the sun on the beach, go shopping at local markets, or explore the historic sites of the region.
     
      <span style="font-weight: 700;">However, it's important to note that all teams must attend all mandatory events and any travel outside of the official ICPC events will be entirely at your own risk and responsibility, and the inDrive app is simply a suggestion for convenient transportation.</span> So use the app wisely, and enjoy all that this beautiful region has to offer!
